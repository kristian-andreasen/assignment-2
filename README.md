# Lost in Translation

This is an online sign language translator as a Single Page Application using the React framework. 

The repo contains a image of the component tree before I wrote any code and a component tree after the implementation.

- The user can either login or create a new account at the “Login page” by entering their name.
- The user can translate English words and short sentences to American sign language at the "Translation page". For each letter in a sentence the corresponding image of the sign language is shown.
- The "Profile Page" displays the last 10 translations for the current user in regular text. There is also a "clear history" button which deletes the translation data from the API. A "logout" button is also available on this page.
